        <h2>Short Bio</h2>
        <h3>Start</h3>
        <p>
          Walter Bruce Willis (born March 19, 1955) is a retired American actor. His career began on the off-Broadway
          stage in the 1970s. He achieved fame with a leading role on the comedy-drama series Moonlighting (1985–1989)
          and appeared in over a hundred films, gaining widespread recognition as an action hero after his portrayal of
          John McClane in the Die Hard franchise (1988–2013) and other roles.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>First Successes</h3>
        <p>
          Willis's other credits include The Last Boy Scout (1991), Pulp Fiction (1994), 12 Monkeys (1995), The Fifth
          Element (1997), Armageddon (1998), The Sixth Sense (1999), Hart's War (2002), Tears of the Sun (2003), Hostage
          (2005), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), and Motherless Brooklyn (2019). In the later years of his career, Willis
          starred in many low-budget direct-to-video films, which were poorly received. In March 2022, Willis's family
          announced that he was retiring after being diagnosed with aphasia, a condition that affects language
          cognition.
        </p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>The Richest Man</h3>
        <p>
          As a singer, Willis released his debut album The Return of Bruno in 1987, followed by two more albums in 1989
          and 2001. He made his Broadway debut in the stage adaptation of Misery in 2015. Willis has received various
          accolades throughout his career, including a Golden Globe Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and two People's
          Choice Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006. Films featuring Willis have grossed
          between US$2.64 billion and $3.05 billion at North American box offices, making him in 2010 the
          eighth-highest-grossing actor in a leading role.
